***README.md:*** Describes solution, relevant files, algorithmic runtime

**Relevant Files:**
answer.py: Contains all functions and driver code for project
test.py: Contains any testing cases I used for individual functions

**Solution:**
Used the Knapsack 0/1 Video as a starting point, and then developed 

**Algorithmic Runtime**: 
This solution works in the time complexity O(nW) where n is the number of items and W is the numerical size of the 
capacity. This is pseudo-polynomial time.
